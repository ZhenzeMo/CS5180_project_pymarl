    <e id="62">Basic Instructions</e>
    <e id="63">Capture cities, towns, and ports to increase your monthly income.</e>
    <e id="64">There are 4 main types of units. Infantry, Artillery, Tanks, and Ships. Air units are for scouting only.</e>
    <e id="65">Trenches are very powerful for defense. After you capture an area, be sure to build some trenches with your infantry.</e>
    <e id="66">How To Win</e>
    <e id="67">Each team starts with 50 warscore, and wins if they reach 100. Warscore is determined by comparing team incomes.</e>
    <e id="68">Advanced Instructions</e>
    <e id="69">Get mortars, artillery or tanks if trench warfare becomes deadlocked.</e>
    <e id="70">Machine Guns are a very cost effective way to counter riflemen. They must be setup like artillery to use their main weapon. (or in a trench)</e>
    <e id="71">Artillery have long range, but they can shoot farther than they can see. Use Observation balloons to take full advantage of their range.</e>
    <e id="72">Riflemen capture empty enemy trenches when they attack, use this to punish an opponent who leaves their trenches empty.</e>
    <e id="73">Use the Research Center to upgrade your troops and unlock new units.</e>
